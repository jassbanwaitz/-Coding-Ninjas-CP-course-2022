/*
Given is the code to print numbers from 1 to n in increasing order recursively. But it contains few bugs that you need to rectify such that all the test cases pass.
Input Format :
Integer n
Output Format :
Numbers from 1 to n (separated by space)
Constraints :
1 <= n <= 10000
Sample Input 1 :
 6
